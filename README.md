# Task Tracker CLI  

Task Tracker is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application to help you manage and track tasks. You can add tasks, update them, delete tasks, and mark their progress. Tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file in the current directory for persistence.
---

## Features  

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with a short description.
- **Update Tasks**: Update the description of an existing task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by their unique ID.
- **Mark Tasks**: Mark tasks as `in-progress` or `done`.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter tasks by their status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
- **Persist Data**: Task data is stored in a JSON file for easy reuse.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs and edge cases.
